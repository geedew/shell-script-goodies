shell-script-goodies
====================

A set of scripts that use and run to help me develop code. Really helps when using tools like Vagrant and Node/Grunt

Many of these scripts are a work in progress. Sometimes they may even be outdated. Make sure you understand what you are doing prior
to wrecking your system. I will not provide technical support if you use these; use at your own risk.
